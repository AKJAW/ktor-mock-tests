This is a sample project for my article [Using Ktor Client Mock Engine for Integration and UI Tests](https://akjaw.com/using-ktor-client-mock-engine-for-integration-and-ui-tests/)

The repository contains tests for fetching GitHub repositories
through the GitHub Search API, but replaces the real network 
calls with pre-defined one's thanks to the Ktor Client MockEngine.
